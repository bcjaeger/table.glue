\title{Round estimates and their corresponding errors}
\usage{
table_ester(
  estimate,
  error,
  form = "{estimate} Â± {error}",
  majority_rule = FALSE
)

table_estin(
  estimate,
  lower,
  upper,
  form = "{estimate} ({lower}, {upper})",
  majority_rule = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimate}{a numeric vector of estimate values.}

\item{error}{a numeric vector of error values. All errors should be >0.}

\item{form}{a character value that indicates how the error and estimate
should be formatted together. Users can specify anything they like
as long as they use the terms \code{estimate} and \code{error} to refer to the
estimate and error values, respectively, and encapsulate those terms
inside of curly brackets, i.e., { } . For instance, if estimate = 1.23
and error = 0.45, then \code{form} = "{estimate} ({error})" will return
"1.2 (0.45)", a common format used in  presentation of the point and
error combination. The default \code{form} gives output in the form of
1.2 +/- 0.45.}

\item{majority_rule}{a logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then the most common
digit used for rounding will be used to round every number given.
Within a single table, consistency in saving digits may be desirable,
so all numbers may be rounded to the place  indicated by the majority
of the numbers. Notably, if a user wants to exercise more control
over the number of decimals shown, they should use \code{\link[=table_glue]{table_glue()}}
with a customized rounding specification (see \link{round_spec}).}

\item{lower}{the lower-bound of an interval for the estimate.}

\item{upper}{the upper-bound of an interval for the estimate.}
}
\value{
a character vector
}
\description{
Though they are not easy to find in print, there are some general
conventions for rounding numbers. When rounding a summary statistic
such as the mean or median, the number of rounded digits shown
should be governed by the precision of the statistic. For instance,
authors are usually asked to present means plus or minus standard
deviations in published research, or regression coefficients plus
or minus the standard error. The convention applied here is to
\enumerate{
\item find the place of the first significant digit of the error
\item round the estimate to that place
\item round the error to 1 additional place
\item present the combination in a form such as estimate (error) or estimate +/- error

\examples{

# ---- examples are taken from Blackstone, 2016 ----

# Example 1: ----
# Mean age is 72.17986, and the standard deviation (SD) is 9.364132.
## Steps:
## - Nine is the first significant figure of the SD.
## - Nine is in the ones place. Thus...
##   + round the mean to the ones place (i.e., round(x, digits = 0))
##   + round the SD to the tenths place (i.e., round(x, digits = 1))
table_ester(estimate = 72.17986, error = 9.364132)
# > [1] 72 +/- 9.4

# an estimated lower and upper bound for 95\% confidence limits
lower <- 72.17986 - 1.96 * 9.364132
upper <- 72.17986 + 1.96 * 9.364132
table_estin(estimate = 72.17986, lower = lower, upper = upper,
            form = "{estimate} (95\% CI: {lower}, {upper})")
# > [1] "72 (95\% CI: 54, 91)"

# Example 2: ----
# Mean cost is $72,347.23, and the standard deviation (SD) is $23,994.06.
## Steps:
## - Two is the first significant figure of the SD.
## - Nine is in the ten thousands place. Thus...
##   + round mean to the 10-thousands place (i.e., round(x, digits = -4))
##   + round SD to the thousands place (i.e., round(x, digits = -3))
table_ester(estimate = 72347.23, error = 23994.06)
# > [1] "70,000 +/- 24,000"

# an estimated lower and upper bound for 95\% confidence limits
lower <- 72347.23 - 1.96 * 23994.06
upper <- 72347.23 + 1.96 * 23994.06
table_estin(estimate = 72347.23, lower = lower, upper = upper,
            form = "{estimate} (95\% CI: {lower} - {upper})")
# > [1] "70,000 (95\% CI: 30,000 - 120,000)"
