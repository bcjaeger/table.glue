## Test environments

- local R installation, R 4.0.2

- ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2

- win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.


There were some NOTEs.

- This is a new release.

- Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  
    + Atherosclerotic (2:44)
  
    + antihypertensive (14:25)
  
    + atherosclerotic (13:3, 16:3)

I have reviewed these words and am comfortable with their spelling.
